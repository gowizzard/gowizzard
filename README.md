# Hi, Iâ€™m Jonas! ðŸš€

A backend and microservices enthusiast with a passion for solving complex problems through clean and efficient code. I primarily use Go for its simplicity and performance, but Iâ€™m always curious to learn new technologies. Currently, Iâ€™m diving into Zig to explore its potential in systems programming and broaden my skill set.

As the co-founder of [J&J Ideenschmiede GmbH](https://jj-ideenschmiede.de), I specialize in developing tailored software solutions to help businesses automate processes and streamline operations. We focus on creating Shopify & Shopware 6 apps, API integrations, and custom tools for various industries. Collaboration and innovation are at the heart of everything we do.
