### Hi there 👋
My name is Jonas and I like to build software. Preferably backends or microservices. That's what I'm currently doing as my main job. For most projects I use GO, because I like the language and the performance is second to none.

If you want to do a project with me, feel free to contact me on one of my profiles.

- 🔭  I’m currently working on microservices, interfaces & api's
- 🌱  I’m currently learning XML, Shell & more
