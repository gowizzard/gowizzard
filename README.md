### Hello there 🌐

My name is Jonas and I like to build software. Preferably backends or microservices. That's what I'm currently doing as my main job. For most projects I use GO, because I like the language and the performance is second to none.

If you want to do a project with me, feel free to contact me on one of my profiles.
