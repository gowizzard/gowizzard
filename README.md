# Hi, Iâ€™m Jonas! ðŸš€

A backend and microservices enthusiast with a passion for scalable and efficient systems. I primarily use Go, but also enjoy working with Docker, Terraform, and Redisâ€”where Iâ€™m a [Redis Certified Developer](https://www.credential.net/8e7adc21-280d-413c-be2c-a7c955c43423). Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Zig to expand my skills in systems programming.

As the co-founder of [J&J Ideenschmiede GmbH](https://jj-ideenschmiede.de), I develop tailored software solutions to help businesses automate processes and streamline operations.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I love to play or whatch tennis! ðŸŽ¾
