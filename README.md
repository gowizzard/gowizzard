# Hi, Iâ€™m Jonas! ðŸš€

A backend and devops enthusiast with a passion for scalable and efficient systems. I primarily use Go, but also enjoy working with Docker, Terraform & Redis. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Zig to expand my skills in systems programming.

As the co-founder of [J&J Ideenschmiede GmbH](https://jj-ideenschmiede.de), I develop tailored software solutions to help businesses automate processes and streamline operations.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I love to play or whatch tennis (in the winter season also paddle)! ðŸŽ¾
